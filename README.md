# WebSocket Broadcast Server

## 📡 Overview

A simple CLI-based WebSocket broadcast server built with Node.js. This tool lets you:

* **Start a WebSocket server**
* **Connect multiple interactive clients via terminal**
* **Broadcast messages between connected clients in real-time**
* **Gracefully handle disconnections with `Ctrl+C`**

> 💡 **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## 🧠 How It Works

| Command                    | Description                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `broadcast-server start`   | Starts the WebSocket server      |
| `broadcast-server connect` | Connects a terminal-based client |

All clients connect to the server and send messages that are broadcast to all other connected clients.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/petrusjohannesmaas/websocket-broadcast-server
cd websocket-broadcast-server
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Create an Alias

```bash
vim ~/.bashrc
```

This will let you run `broadcast-server` globally from anywhere.

## 📦 Usage

**Start the WebSocket Server:**

```bash
broadcast-server start
```

* Starts the server on `ws://localhost:8080`
* Logs client connections and broadcasts

**Connect Clients:**

Run these commands in separate terminals to simulate multiple clients.

```bash
broadcast-server connect
```

* Prompts for a nickname
* Lets you send messages interactively
* Messages are broadcast to all other connected clients

## 🛑 Graceful Shutdown

* Press `Ctrl+C` in any terminal to disconnect
* Server will notify all clients and close connections

## 🧪 Example Session

**Terminal A:**

```bash
broadcast-server start
# Output: Broadcast server running at ws://localhost:8080
```

**Terminal B:**

```bash
broadcast-server connect
Enter your nickname: Alice
Alice> Hello!
```

**Terminal C:**

```bash
broadcast-server connect
Enter your nickname: Bob
Bob> Hey Alice!
# Terminal B sees: Received: Bob: Hey Alice!
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Add command line options (`--port`, `--nickname`)
* Add secure WebSocket (`wss://`) support
* Add user authentication
* Add message history or logging
* Convert to TypeScript
* Migrate to Deno from Node
* gRPC or GraphQL API
